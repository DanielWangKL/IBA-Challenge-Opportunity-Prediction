# International Business Analytics (IBA) Challenge - Opportunity Realization Prediction
Participants of IBA are required to propose recommendations on how to leverage the wealth of data in AIESEC to achieve its business goal.

One of the recommendation will be leveraging binary classification model to quantify the likelihood of realisation of each opportunity to allow the staff to optimise their marketing effort. Also, this model could also be leveraged to enhance the intelligence of the online platform when promoting opportunities. This is to answer the second question from AIESEC which is listed in the background below.

This repository will present the end-to-end machine learning process for the proof-of-concept of this recommendation.

The whole process will be a combination of R and Python. Since I had a stronger knowledge in business analytics with R(dplyr, ggplot) and machine learning knoweldge with Python (Keras, scikit-learn) by then, I just used the corresponding tools to quickly prototype the model.

# Background
"In January 2019, AIESEC has decided to use the large amount of data it has accumulated over time to help it become more efficient in realizing its mission and to guide its numerical transformation. However, AIESEC does not currently have enough data scientists to assist it on this task. As a result, AIESEC has approached your firm to help them explore and generate value from their data given their current challenges. Your company specializes in business translation for data science and your team of experts has been hired to help AIESEC find solutions using the data they have at their disposal.

AIESEC currently has three main questions it would like you to answer using its data:
1. How to increase the number of exchange opportunities posted by organizations on aiesec.org?
2. How to increase the proportion of posted opportunities that find a suited candidate (realized traineeships)?
3. How to define and measure AIESEC impact on exchange participants leadership?"
